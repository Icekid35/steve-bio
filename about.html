                        <h2 class="section-title">Who Was Steve Jobs?</h2>
                        <p class="section-subtitle">Steve Jobs was a visionary American inventor, entrepreneur, and designer who played a pivotal role in shaping the modern technology landscape. Born in 1955 to University of Wisconsin graduate students, he was adopted as an infant by Paul and Clara Jobs. Despite being highly intelligent, Jobs struggled to find direction in his early years, dropping out of college and exploring various interests.</p>
                        <p class="section-subtitle">In 1976, Jobs co-founded Apple Inc. alongside Steve Wozniak, setting the stage for a technological revolution. Although he left Apple in 1985, he went on to establish Pixar Animation Studios, which became a leader in computer-animated films. Jobs returned to Apple in the late 1990s, ushering in an era of groundbreaking innovations like the iPhone, iPad, and iPod that redefined how we interact with technology.</p>
                        <p class="section-subtitle">After a long battle with pancreatic cancer, Jobs passed away in 2011, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and creativity that continues to influence the world.</p>

                        <p class="section-subtitle">
                            Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, to Joanne Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali, who were graduate students at the University of Wisconsin at the time. Unable to raise their child, the couple decided to place him for adoption.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Jobs was adopted as an infant by Clara and Paul Jobs, who named him Steven Paul Jobs. Clara worked as an accountant, while Paul, a Coast Guard veteran, made a living as a machinist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jobs’ biological father, Abdulfattah Jandali, was of Syrian descent and pursued a career as a political science professor. His biological mother, Joanne Schieble (later Joanne Simpson), became a speech therapist. After Steve’s adoption, Schieble and Jandali married and had a daughter, Mona Simpson, who would go on to become a successful novelist. Jobs discovered the identity of his biological parents when he was 27 years old.

                            Here’s a rewritten version to ensure originality and a natural tone:
                            
                            Steve Jobs’ net worth was estimated to have peaked at $8.3 billion shortly before his death in 2011, according to Forbes. Some estimates, such as those from Celebrity Net Worth, suggest it may have been as high as $10.2 billion.
                            
                            If Jobs had held onto his original Apple stake from its 1980 initial public offering, it would have been worth approximately $330 billion by January 2022, when Apple’s market capitalization reached a staggering $3 trillion. This would have made him wealthier than Tesla founder Elon Musk and comfortably the richest person in the world. However, Jobs sold nearly all of his Apple shares when he left the company in 1985, retaining just one share.
                            
                            The majority of Jobs’ wealth came from his approximately 8% stake in Disney, which he acquired when Pixar was sold to Disney in 2006. As of 2022, that stake, now passed on to his wife, Laurene Powell Jobs, is valued at an estimated $22 billion.

                        <p class="section-subtitle">
                            Steve Jobs passed away at the age of 56 in his Palo Alto, California, home on October 5, 2011. His death was officially attributed to respiratory arrest, a complication arising from his prolonged battle with pancreatic cancer.

In his final weeks, Jobs grew frail, struggling to climb the stairs of his home, as reported by The New York Times. Despite his declining health, he found the strength to bid farewell to some of his closest colleagues, including Disney CEO Bob Iger, and to offer guidance to Apple executives regarding the iPhone 4S launch. He also spent time speaking with his biographer.

In a heartfelt eulogy, Jobs’ sister Mona Simpson described his final moments. Before passing, he gazed at his sister, his wife Laurene, and his children before looking past them and uttering his last words: “Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.”</p>
